# PathFinding-Visualization

- The project started with fiddling around with the Pygame library
- The version 1 of the project involved only A* algorithm
- Subsequently, in version 2, the algorithm and deployment was much more simplified
- Other algorithms- Dijkstra's and BFS were later added
* Since it's an unweighted graph, Bthere's no real difference between how the program works for BFS and DFS


```
#first double click =  start point
#second double click = end point
#keeping left mouse button pressed, move the mouse to make walls
#keeping right mouse button pressed, move the mouse to delete walls


press a for A*
press d for Dijkstra
press b for BFS
```

## Motivation and Scope:
Pathfinding algorithms are usually an attempt to solve the shortest path problem in graph theory. They try to find the best path given a starting point and ending point clearing all the obstacles. In graph theory, the shortest path problem is the problem of finding a path between two vertices (or nodes) in a graph such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized. It is used in real world applications in maps, delivery and pooling services.


## Future development
- deploy different and better algorithm's like best first search, etc
